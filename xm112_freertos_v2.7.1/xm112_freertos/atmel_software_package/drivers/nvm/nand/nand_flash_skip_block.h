 /**
 * \page skip_nand_page SkipBlockNandFlash
 *
 * \section Purpose
 *
 * SkipBlockNandFlash layer supplies application a set of interface to operate NANDFLASH, which include
 * initialize, block erase, block write/read, page write/read. This layer is called by upper layer
 * applications, and it will call lower layer drivers, such as \ref ecc_nand_page, \ref raw_nand_page.
 *
 * \section Usage
 * -# nand_skipblock_initialize() is used to initializes a SkipBlockNandFlash instance. Scans
 *      the device to retrieve or create block status information.
 * -# nand_skipblock_erase_block() is used to erase a certain block in the device, user can
 *      select "check block status before erase" or "erase without check"
 * -# User can use nand_skipblock_write_block() to write a certain block and nand_skipblock_write_page()
 *      to write a certain page. The functions will check the block status before write, if the block
 *      is not a good block, the write command will not be issued.
 * -# User can use nand_skipblock_read_block() to read a certain block and nand_skipblock_read_page()
 *      to read a certain page. The functions will check the block status before read, if the block
 *      is not a good block, the read command will not be issued. ECC is also checked after read
 *      operation is finished, an error will be reported if ecc check got errors.
